Exception is an abnormal condition condition that occur at run time

Python provides with 3 keywords:

Some errors:
* ZeroDivisionError: divide by zero
* ArgumentError: incorrect type or no. of argument

if error occur only the execution of that particular block terminates

eg: closing database, setting password to null before exit
- The interpreter goes into this block even if error is not encountered

# Exception is super class of all exceptions
